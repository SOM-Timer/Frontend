# Som Timer
Som Timer is a timer that cares. Based on the Pomodoro technique™️, this application provides users with curated wellness content during break intervals. Build in rest, so you can focus best.

## Installation Instructions
If you would like to install the repos locally instead of visiting the deployed sites, follow these directions:

1. Clone down the [Front End Repository](https://github.com/SOM-Timer/som_timer_fe) by running `git clone git@github.com:SOM-Timer/som_timer_fe.git <...>` in the terminal, where `<...>` is an optional argument to customize the name of your local repo.
2. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies

## Future Directions
This current version of the app is just the beginning, and we would like to significantly expand our scope. The following are our plans for future iterations: 
- Add Users
  - As this app was initially built in just 2 weeks, the demo does not include unique users. We would like to add the ability to create users, complete with sign-up and log-in screens. 
- Expand customization
  - We want to ensure that Som Timer works well for all users, so we would like to expand our customization options on the Settings page. Current ideas for this include adding the ability to disable mood ratings, toggle between a light and dark mood, and select the categories of content the user can then choose from during breaks. 
- Allow a user to upload content
  - In the vein of expanding customization, we would also like to give the user the ability to add new content to their personal library by uploading links from YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, and other platforms.
